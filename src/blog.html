                    <p>With every new season comes the chance for a fresh start. You can try a new class at the gym, take control of your finances, and of course, organize your home! And if you need a little motivation with the cleaning, we’re here to help.<br> 
                    <br> 

        Take these eight steps to spring-clean your home, and make your space all the more enjoyable.<br><br>

        1) <em>First, clear the air:</em> To set the scene, you’ll want your place to smell clean and fresh. The <a class="nav-button" href="products.aspx?p=3" target="_blank">Dyson Pure Cool Link<sup>TM</sup> purifier fan</a> will help improve air quality by reducing household odours and allergens. You can also stay cool throughout your cleanup with its 2-in-1 functionality as a purifier and a fan.<br><br>

        2) <em>De-clutter your space:</em> Your place will never be neat and tidy if you collect too many knick-knacks, unnecessary kitchen tools and clothes you never wear—you know what we mean. Take a good long look at your belongings. Consider donating things you no longer need, host a clothing swap, or sell bigger items online.<br><br>

        3) <em>Scrub out those stains:</em> It happens to everyone. You’re holding a drink and knock your arm. Or you accidentally fling a little salsa onto the carpet. No need to panic—you can put those stains out of sight and out of mind. Simply soak the stain in vinegar, sprinkle on some baking soda and let it bubble. Then, wipe and vacuum it up!<br><br>

        4) <em>Get out your Dyson:</em> If you need to cover a lot of ground, consider the <a class="nav-button" href="products.aspx?p=4" target="_blank">Dyson Cinetic<sup>TM</sup> upright vacuum</a>. It’s great for big home cleans—and for anyone with pets or allergies since it’s Asthma &amp; Allergy certified. The Dyson Cinetic upright vacuum comes with extra tools, so you can get into all those nooks and crannies. Plus, it’s so efficient you never have to replace or wash your vacuum filter.<br><br>

        5) <em>Really get in there!</em> If you have a smaller space or want help with daily cleanups, the <a class="nav-button" href="products.aspx?p=0" target="_blank">Dyson V6 Absolute cord-free vacuum</a> is for you. This cord-free machine is engineered for a powerful clean to tackle frequent cleaning and hard-to-reach places. It can also be converted to a handheld vacuum, which is great for cleaning the car, your mattress, or other upholstery.<br><br> 

        6) <em>Polish those tiles:</em> When was the last time you gave your bathroom a good scrub? If you have to think about it, it’s time! Roll up your sleeves, and mix a simple paste of baking soda and water. Then, using an old toothbrush, clean the grout and make those tiles sparkle.<br><br> 

        7) <em>Take time to tidy:</em> Now that your space is clean and clutter-free, it’ll be much easier to tidy—and keep it that way! Use a filing cabinet or decorative boxes to organize items you don’t use regularly (think papers, computer cords, etc.), and live by the mantra “a place for everything and everything in its place.”<br><br>

        8) <em>Sit back and relax:</em> It’s time to admire all of your hard work. Make yourself comfortable with the <a class="nav-button" href="products.aspx?p=2" target="_blank">Dyson AM09 Hot + Cool<sup>TM</sup> fan heater</a>. It does double-duty, acting as a cool fan in the warmer months and a heater fan in the cooler months, helping you stay comfortable year-round.<br><br>
